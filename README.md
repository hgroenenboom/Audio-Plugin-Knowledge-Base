# Audio Plugin Knowledge Base

Welcome to this repository, a resource dedicated to sharing detailed insights and solutions we've discovered while developing audio plugins. Our aim is to help the community navigate some of the specific challenges and exceptions that can arise during plugin development.

While the information provided here currently references JUCE, we encourage contributions that showcase alternative solutions or approaches. Our goal is to create a community-driven guideline, checklist, and knowledge base that benefits everyone involved in audio plugin development.

We invite you to contribute, share your experiences, and help build a comprehensive resource for all things related to plugin development!
